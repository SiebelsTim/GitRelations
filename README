To compile you need to install libgit2, qt and libgraphviz

    sudo apt-get install libgit2-dev qt5-default libgraphviz-dev

Then you can configure the project

    cmake .

If you get an error that it could not find libgitcpp, you can hint cmake to it

    cmake -DPC_LIBGITCPP_INCLUDEDIR=/path/to/libgitcpp/include .

And then start compiling

    make


Note: This repository contains a 64bit version of libgitcpp. If you are compiling on a 32bit system, you need to compile libgitcpp yourself
