To compile this library, you need to have libgit2 installed and have checked out the submodules

To do this, run:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update

    sudo apt-get install libgit2-dev

Then compile:

    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make

You'll find a static library in the build folder.
